## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Webkit

### What I learned

Coding this challenge helped me practice using flexbox, grid, and CSS with media queries to display the correct CSS styles for the different layouts. I was also able to work on my javascript and validation. It was a simple yet difficult challenge and I enjoyed the chance to work on my development skills. 

### Continued development

I want to continue to advance my knowledge and skills as a developer. I am glad this was able to reinforce my CSS and JS skills and I want to continue to improve and learn new ways of styling. I hope to keep developing in a way that makes me happy and keeps every experience fresh.
